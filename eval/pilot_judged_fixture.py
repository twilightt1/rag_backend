"""Pilot benchmark run: fixture haystack → simulated memory recall → LLM judge.

Honest pilot protocol (per eval/benchmarks/README hygiene rules):
- The dataset is REAL schema (the CI fixture: 2 instances) and every judge
  verdict is a REAL LLM call through the gateway in .env — nothing here is
  fabricated.
- The MEMORY SYSTEM being scored is simulated: a haystack-reading baseline
  ("full-context reader") that answers from the raw sessions. This is a
  PLUMBING VALIDATION of the judge path, NOT a LongMemEval headline score —
  the README's baseline-completeness rule still applies (no full-context
  baseline claim is recorded beyond what this pilot measures).
- Results land in eval/benchmarks/results/ with judge prompt version +
  per-question verdicts, so any later real run can be compared honestly.
