"""LLM judge for LongMemEval answers (pinned protocol).

LongMemEval's official protocol judges ALL question types with an LLM, not
just short numeric answers (see
https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval — src/evaluation/evaluate_qa.py).
The exact-match guard in ``longmemeval_s.judge_answer`` covers the small
deterministic subset; everything else needs this judge.

Judge prompt: pinned to the official LongMemEval judge prompt semantics —
the judge sees the question, the gold answer, and the model response, and
answers a strict yes/no "is the response equivalent to the gold answer".
The version constant below MUST be bumped whenever the prompt changes; run
reports record it (leaderboard hygiene rule 1, see eval/benchmarks/README).

Requires ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` (the same client the backend uses). When the
key is absent every judge call raises ``JudgeUnavailable`` — the runner
surfaces that as ``pending_interpretation`` rather than a fabricated score.
